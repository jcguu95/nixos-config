###### 1. Backup

## The following way is deprecated as it does not contain history on live.
# histDir="$HOME/.local/share/qutebrowser/history.sqlite"
# sqlite3 "$histDir" .dump
## Instead, we dump history by:
qutebrowser ":download qute://history/data -d $HOME/.nb/qb_history/$(date -Is).json"
## Notice that this way you may only fetch history for the past 24 hours.

###### 2. Clear
qutebrowser ":history-clear"

exit
