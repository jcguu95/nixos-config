But did you ever wonder why mushrooms have such a meaty texture?

Approaching problems this way also changed the way my team behaved for the better. Often the hardest part of working as a team is giving people permission to bring up ideas that are ultimately ruled out. People tend to self-censor to avoid looking or sounding wrong, because they assume everyone else is keepIng score. When we allow this on a team it creates blindspots. Fortunately, humans are very bad with probabilities. Very bad. I became comfortable with being wrong 95% of the time because I understood that when I found that one critical problem all the ideas I had before that had been ruled out would be forgotten. I found a few problems much more experienced engineers had missed and it gave me super powers in the eyes of my colleagues.

When I find myself itching to interrupt someone with my thoughts about a topic I try to ask myself “what am I being asked to be an expert in here?” Often I realize that in my enthusiasm to show my casual knowledge I’m about to correct someone that who has devoted a considerable amount of time and effort into developing their expertise in the topic.

I don’t think so. There are three absolutely critical things you cannot do unless you break out your areas of responsibility into clearly articulated projects.

What is the right mix of short-term to long-term projects (or research vs. production, or planning vs. execution, or analysis vs. synthesis, or any other dichotomy)?

You can easily see how failing to make this distinction leads to common frustrations: if you have a project that you think is an area (for example, the book I’ve been “writing” for a couple years now, that feels like a never-ending part of my life), it will tend to continue indefinitely.

The bottom line here is, define your projects, or they will define you. 	The PARA Method: A Universal System for Organizing Digital Information | Praxis	https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/	2019-08-10T08:51:15-05:00
The first principle is that it uses the number 4 as a guidepost. The entire hierarchy is four categories wide (projects, areas, resources, archives), and no more than four levels deep (using Evernote as an example, the levels would be: application > stacks > notebooks > notes).

That was four years ago, folks. That engineer has moved on to greener pastures. Too bad; he was really good.  It's all C++'s fault. Don't argue. It is. We're using the dumbest language in the world.

I know, this is Heresy, with a capital-'H'. Whatever. I loved C++ in college, because it's all I knew. When I heard that my languages prof, Craig Chambers, absolutely detested C++, I thought: "Why? I like it just fine." And when I heard that the inventor of STL was on record as saying he hated OOP, I thought he was cracked. How could anyone hate OOP, especially the inventor of STL? 	tour-de-babel - steveyegge2	https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel	2019-08-10T20:42:18-05:00
Familiarity breeds contempt in most cases, but not with computer languages. You have to become an expert with a better language before you can start to have contempt for the one you're most familiar with.   	tour-de-babel - steveyegge2	https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel	2019-08-10T20:42:35-05:00
They all used Emacs, of course. Hell, Eric Benson was one of the authors of XEmacs1. All of the greatest engineers in the world use Emacs. The world-changer types. Not the great gal in the cube next to you. Not Fred, the amazing guy down the hall. I'm talking about the greatest software developers of our profession, the ones who changed the face of the industry. The James Goslings, the Donald Knuths, the Paul Grahams2, the Jamie Zawinskis, the Eric Bensons. Real engineers use Emacs. You have to be way smart to use it well, and it makes you incredibly powerful if you can master it. Go look over Paul Nordstrom's shoulder while he works sometime, if you don't believe me. It's a real eye-opener for someone who's used Visual Blub .NET-like IDEs their whole career. 	tour-de-babel - steveyegge2	https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel	2019-08-10T20:44:38-05:00
