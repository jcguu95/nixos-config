# Nix is the future

## TODOs

+ Import scripts, especially the recording tools and `dmenu`.
+ Setup `nvim`.
+ Setup `ssh` and a listening server.

### Harder

1. Compile lukesmith's build of `st` with nix derivation.
2. Reproducibly setup wallpaper.
3. Setup development environment `haskell`.
4. Reproducibly configure `emacs`.
