# Nix is the future

## TODOs

+ Setup `ssh` and a listening server.

### Harder

+ Compile lukesmith's build of `st` with nix derivation.
+ Setup development environment `haskell`.
+ Reproducibly configure `emacs`.
+ Setup ibus input method.
+ Understand source of `xmonad` and [apply
  transparency](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43998105/making-every-window-transparent-with-xmonad/43998106#43998106).
+ Understand how to tweak xmobar and integrate it with dmenurecord.
+ Rescue `~/.config` from impurity :( .. this seems like a [hard
  issue](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/issues/257).
+ Setup dictionary in qutebrowser.
